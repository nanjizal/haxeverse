Creating Shapes
===============

## Targets ##

Haxe is programming toolkit that provides a lot of freedom to create shapes within a range of programming ecosystems, 
it's impossible for me to cover everything but we can take a broad look.
There are lots of approaches some we might considered more native like for example these:

### Native ###

- Javascript DOM and Image
- Javascript SVG
- Javascript Canvas API
- Javascript WebGL
- Java Swing / AWT ( Graphics2D )
- Java LWJGL / SLICK 
- Flash Drawing API
- TODO: add c#, python ?

And some approaches use a cross target ecosystem like these:

### Cross Target ###

- NME / OpenFL / Flash AIR
- Electron Node
- Flambe
- Luxe
- KHA

## Image, Pixel, Graphics or GPU ##

But perhaps a better way to separate approaches is between drawing systems that provide a simple Graphics drawing API
and systems that are closer to the metal using the GPU, we can further break that down.

### Image ###
- Javascript DOM 
- Flash Bitmap
- Kha G2
- Java AWT 

### Pixel ### 
- Javascript ..
- Flash BitmapData
- 

### Graphics Drawing ###
- Javascript Canvas
- Javascript SVG
- Java AWT
- Flash Graphics

### GPU ###
- Javascript WebGL
- Luxe
- Kha G4

## Triangle is King ##

### GPU setup ###
- Lwjgl
- Luxe
- Kha G2, G4
